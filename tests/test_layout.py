"""Layout checks that need no pictures (#155): every surface the visual
probe photographs, opened the same way on a hidden window, with no text
cut off, no controls on top of each other and nothing outside the window.

The surfaces and the measuring are the probe's (``tools/ui_probe.py``), so
what fails here is what the probe flags in its pictures. A failure names the
control and the problem; ``tools/ui_probe_vm.ps1`` in the test VM shows what
it looks like.

Problems already filed are listed in ``KNOWN`` with their issue. Each
surface's test expects exactly its known problems: a new one fails, and so
does a known one that has gone, so its entry is removed when the issue is
fixed. Windows only: what's cut off depends on the controls' and fonts'
sizes, and the probe's baseline is Windows.
