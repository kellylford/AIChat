"""Finding the code blocks in a message (#17), to list, read and copy them.

A fenced block opens with three or more backticks or tildes, at any indent
or in a quote (Claude nests code in list items), or after text on a line,
and closes on a line of the same character, at least as long, with nothing
after it; an unclosed block runs to the end, as Markdown does. The word
after the opening fence is the language ("```python").
