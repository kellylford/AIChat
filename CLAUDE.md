# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

The Chat Place: a wxPython desktop app for Windows and macOS (Windows came first) that is a keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly
reader for Claude Code sessions. It lists the Claude desktop app's sessions, shows each as an
arrowable conversation, announces when a session answers, and can run sessions of its own through
`claude -p` (headless, stream-json) on the user's subscription, never an API key. Accessibility with
JAWS and NVDA is the point of the app, so every UI change has to work by keyboard and be named and
announced for a screen reader.

The README is the user-facing spec. It is long and detailed, and it lists the shortcuts, file
locations and behaviour. Keep it in step with behaviour changes.

## Commands

```
./macsetup.sh  |  winsetup.bat                     # make .venv from requirements-build.txt (replaces an existing one)
.venv/bin/python -m thechatplace                   # run from source (Windows: .venv\Scripts\pythonw TheChatPlace.pyw)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests                # what CI runs, on Windows and macOS
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_claude_cli.py -k resume   # one file / one test
BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh           # tests, app, Velopack osx feed, .dmg; signed if the keychain has a Developer ID
BuildAndRelease\WinBuilds\build_windows.cmd         # Windows: tests, app, Velopack installer and feed (always unsigned)
python tools/check_version.py [vTAG]               # print version / check a tag against it
```

- Tests of Windows-only behaviour (made-up `C:\` paths, MSAA via `wx.Accessible`) are marked with
  `windows_paths` / `msaa` from `tests/markers.py` and skip elsewhere. Use them for new tests of that
  kind rather than letting the macOS CI job fail.
- PyInstaller is pinned in `requirements-build.txt`, and `vpk` must match the `velopack` version in
  `requirements.txt` (1.2.161) everywhere it's installed. The PyInstaller command lines live in
  three places that must agree: `build_windows.cmd`, `build_macos.sh`, and the Windows job of
  `release-thechatplace.yml` (the Mac job calls `build_macos.sh`).
- The built app supports `--smoke-test out.json`. It imports everything and checks the data files
  (each platform's speech scripts; `WebView2Loader.dll` on Windows). A new lazily imported module
  or data file needs adding to those command lines.
- Mac build (follows GHManage): sign inside-out with `sign.sh` (never `codesign --deep`), then
  `vpk pack --signDisableDeep` adds `Contents/MacOS/UpdateMac` and signs it and the bundle; the
  `.dmg` is made from the app in `TheChatPlace-osx-Portable.zip` (named "The Chat Place.app"),
  never from `dist/`, and the build fails unless the packed app's smoke test reports
  `"updater": "<version>"`. `TCP_SIGN_CODE=0|1` (default: sign if a certificate exists),
  `TCP_NOTARIZE=1`. `TheChatPlace.entitlements` (vpk insists on the extension) includes Apple
  Events, which VoiceOver speech (`osascript`) needs under the hardened runtime.
- Signing secrets come from `~/Documents/GitHub/The-Idea-Place-Projects/signing` (`repos.json`,
  `sync-secrets.py`), not by hand.

## Releasing

The version lives in one place: `__version__` in `thechatplace/__init__.py`. To release, bump it and
add `release-notes/v<version>.md` in the same commit, then push the tag `v<version>`. The release
workflow fails if the tag and `__version__` disagree, or if the notes file is missing. It builds
Windows and macOS in parallel jobs, and a `publish` job makes the release only if both succeed
(the Windows installer, portable zip and `windows` feed; the notarized `.dmg` and `osx` feed).
Versions below 1.0 publish as pre-releases. Both platforms update through Velopack
(`updater.CHANNEL`). Velopack calls every Mac app portable, so the portable check is Windows-only
(`updater.PORTABLE_COPIES_EXIST`); applying it on a Mac silently stops all Mac updates.

**Release notes and the user guide, with every user-visible change** (the QuickMail process):
- The **open** notes file is the highest `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` with no matching tag. Add an
  entry there with each PR, citing it (`(#90)`); if none is open, start the next patch version's
  file. Internal changes (tests, CI, refactors) need no entry. `__version__` is bumped only in
  the release commit, so the notes file can wait on main ahead of it.
- The order: a short intro (what it updates, pre-release or not, that it offers itself as an
  update), then **Changed**, **Fixed** and **Added** as needed (what shipped is what people came to
  read), then the footers, copied from the last release: **Reporting Issues**, **Downloads**,
  **Requirements**, and the independence line.
- Write for users: say what they'll notice, in plain words, with the menu path and the key. Don't
  name a screen reader unless the change is specific to one; say "screen readers".
- The **README is the user guide**: update it in the same PR whenever behaviour changes, along
  with `ui_text.py` (`SHORTCUTS`) and `tools/make_docs.py`'s output in `docs/` when a key changes.

## Architecture

**Data flow.** The app reads files that belong to the Claude desktop app and Claude Code. Their
formats are undocumented, and it never writes to them:
- `sessions.py`: the desktop app's session metadata (`claude-code-sessions/**/local_*.json`, both
  the regular and the Microsoft Store locations) and live busy/idle state (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`).
- `transcript.py`: the only module that knows the `.jsonl` transcript format. It must skip unknown
  record types and never crash on a bad line (it counts them instead), and it reads incrementally.
  Keep all knowledge of the transcript format in this module.
- `hub.py`: gathers a whole `Snapshot` on a background thread and notices finished turns. It returns
  plain data.
- `own_store.py`, `groups.py`: the app's own state in `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace` (the only place it writes).
  `desktop_groups.py` reads the desktop app's groups without changing them.
- `platform_paths.py`: **every** path and OS call (each has `win32` and `darwin` branches) (Windows job objects, pid checks, opening URLs,
  finding `claude.exe`). OS-specific code goes here, so a port changes only this file and the speech
  scripts. Tests monkeypatch its functions (`desktop_sessions_dirs`, `projects_dir`,
  `app_data_dir`, …) to point at `tmp_path`.

**Running turns (`claude_cli.py`).** Builds the `claude -p` command lines, runs a turn in a
kill-on-close Windows job (started suspended, then assigned to the job), parses stream-json into
`TurnEvent`s, and answers `can_use_tool` control requests (permissions, AskUserQuestion,
ExitPlanMode) over stdin. Safety invariants that have tests; keep them:
- **Desktop sessions are read-only.** Refuse to build `--resume` for any session the app didn't
  start, any id the desktop app knows (archived included), or any `local_` id. The only exception is
  Continue Here, which uses `--fork-session` into a new id.
- Never use `--bare`. Refuse the npm `claude.cmd`, because a command run through cmd.exe could be
  injected from a session title.
- Strip the environment variables that are inherited from a parent Claude session, and the ones
  that would move billing off the subscription (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
  Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry …). Abort the run if `claude` reports an API-key credential source.

**UI (`ui/`).** `main_frame.py` is the large `MainFrame`. Background work (snapshots, chat
loading, turns, update checks, sign-in, slash-command fetches) runs on threads and returns to the
UI only through `wx.CallAfter`. Timers drive list and chat refreshes. `a11y.py` gives controls
MSAA names, and through `mac_a11y.py` (ctypes, no PyObjC) VoiceOver names too, because wx's
`SetName` reaches neither. `mac_a11y.py` is the one exception to "OS calls go in
`platform_paths.py`": it needs a control's native view, and it also holds `activate_app`, which
gives the app the menu bar (VO+M) when the window is raised. `announce.py` decides what is spoken, and `speech.py` plus `speech/*.ps1|*.sh` speak it
through the screen reader or a system voice. `ui_text.py` holds UI text that can be tested without wx
(the `LAYOUT` and `SHORTCUTS` lists, which the Help dialog and the README both show).

**Other modules:** `updater.py` (Velopack updates for installed copies only, which refuse to run
if the data folder is inside the install folder), `rendering.py` (markdown to safe HTML for the
WebView2 formatted view), `usage.py`, `changes.py`, `codeblocks.py`, `attachments.py`, `export.py`,
`bugreport.py`, `signin.py`.

## Tests

- `tests/records.py` builds **synthetic** transcript records shaped like Claude Code's. Never copy
  real conversation content into tests.
- `tests/fake_claude.py` stands in for `claude -p` stream-json (`FAKE_CLAUDE_MODE=hang|ask`,
  `FAKE_CLAUDE_LOG`). Use it for turn, cancel and permission tests.
- `test_ui_hidden.py` builds `MainFrame` hidden, with fixtures that monkeypatch paths, speech
  (`spoken`/`feedback` recorders), clipboard, sign-in, `fetch_commands`, `open_url` and the
  formatted view. New UI tests should use its `env` fixture so no test touches real `%APPDATA%`,
  real `claude`, or speaks aloud.

## Conventions

- Comments and docstrings explain *why* in plain prose and often cite GitHub issue numbers (`#190`).
  Commit messages are one plain-English sentence about the user-visible change, ending in issue/PR
  refs, e.g. `Code blocks: list, read and copy each one (#17) (#43)`.
- Never write to the desktop app's files or to any transcript.
