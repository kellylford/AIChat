# The visual probe

The probe (#155) opens every screen of The Chat Place on made-up data, and saves a
picture of each with a JSON description of its controls. Claude then reviews the
pictures against a checklist and describes them in words. That's how the app's look is
checked without anyone needing to see it.

## What it photographs

`python tools/ui_probe.py --list` lists the surfaces:
- the main window in several states (as it opens, an own session, mid-turn, a desktop
  session, tool activity, the Last message column, an update waiting, no sessions);
- every dialog, opened through its own menu command wherever the made-up data allows;
- the formatted view (shortcuts, user guide, a message with a heading, list, code, table
  and link).

`tests/test_ui_probe.py` fails if a dialog class has no surface, so a new dialog has to
be added to the probe.

The data is the hidden-window tests' (`tests/fake_env.py`): no real sessions, no real
`%APPDATA%`, no real `claude`, no speech.

## Windows: in the test VM

The probe shows real windows, and the variants change Windows' theme and scaling, so it
runs in the ClaudeTesting VM, never on a PC someone is using. From the repo:

```
vmtest begin
powershell -File tools\ui_probe_vm.ps1                       # every variant
powershell -File tools\ui_probe_vm.ps1 -Variant light-100,dark-100 -Surface settings,permission
vmtest save                                                  # when done for now
```

The variants are in `tools/ui_probe_plan.json`:
- light at 100, 150 and 175% scaling;
- dark apps;
- High Contrast Aquatic and Desert.

`tools/ui_probe_guest.ps1` sets each one inside the VM, runs the probe, and puts the display
back. It refuses to run outside a virtual machine.

For a run, the VM is switched to its largest screen mode, 1920 by 1080. Windows allows up to
175% on that screen, so 200% would need ClaudeTesting's Hyper-V display set larger. The first
run installs Python 3.12, the Visual C++ runtime and the app's packages in the VM, which
takes a few minutes. The pictures come back to a new folder under `%TEMP%\tcp-ui-probe`.

At 150% and 175% the pictures are screen copies in real pixels, because the app isn't DPI
aware (#185): Windows draws it at 100% and stretches it, and the pictures show that, as a
person would see it. The main window is shrunk to fit the screen, as the app does.

Each `manifest-<tag>.json` records what the variant really was: the scaling, the work area
the windows were fitted to, High Contrast, and Windows' own dark mode setting
(`windows_apps_dark`; wx's `dark` says whether the app's colours are dark, which is a
different question).

## macOS: by hand

On a Mac, from the repo with its `.venv`, and with Screen Recording allowed for the
terminal (System Settings, Privacy & Security, Screen Recording):

```
.venv/bin/python tools/ui_probe.py --out ~/Desktop/tcp-probe --tag mac-light
```

Switch to Dark appearance and run it again with `--tag mac-dark`. A Mac has no WebView2,
so the formatted-page surfaces show the plain-text dialogs there, as the app does.

## Comparing with the baseline

The pictures and descriptions of the last accepted run are in `testing/visual/baseline/windows/`,
with each variant's manifest. To see what a change did:

```
.venv\Scripts\python tools\ui_compare.py %TEMP%\tcp-ui-probe\<run>
```

It needs the app's venv, for wx. It writes `compare.md` in the run folder, listing each screen
that changed and what changed in words:
- controls gone, new, moved or resized by more than 2 pixels;
- enabled or disabled, text, values, list items and selections;
- new layout problems.

It also gives the share of pixels that changed, which catches colour and theme changes the
layout can't see. For each changed screen, `diff\<screen>.png` marks the changed pixels in red.

Screens the probe reported as failed are listed separately and not compared. It exits with 1 when
anything changed, is missing or failed. New screens alone give 0: they have no baseline yet.

A run of some variants is compared only with those variants. Two runs of the same code compare
as unchanged:
- anti-aliasing differences are within the tolerance;
- the window's outer border, drawn by Windows, isn't compared;
- the 150% and 175% pictures stop at the taskbar.

When the review agrees the changes are right, accept them into the baseline in the same PR:

```
.venv\Scripts\python tools\ui_compare.py %TEMP%\tcp-ui-probe\<run> --accept                    # the whole run
.venv\Scripts\python tools\ui_compare.py %TEMP%\tcp-ui-probe\<run> --accept settings-light-100   # one screen
```

A name that isn't in the run leaves the baseline untouched. When a surface is taken out of the
probe, `git rm` its pictures and descriptions from the baseline too, or every comparison reports
them missing.

A Mac run needs its own baseline folder (`--baseline testing/visual/baseline/macos`). Against the
Windows one, every screen would show as new.

The baseline is about 15 MB. The dark-100 pictures are almost all the same as light-100 for now,
because the app doesn't follow Windows dark mode yet (#177). They stay so that the day it does,
the change shows. Accept only the screens that changed, rather than a whole run, to keep the
repository's history from growing by a full set each time.

A formatted page (WebView2) now and then fails to draw in a freshly reset VM. The probe tries
once more on a new window. If it's still blank, it reports the screen as an error, and `--accept`
refuses any screen the run reported as failed, so a blank picture never becomes the baseline.
Run that screen again.

## Reviewing a run

Ask Claude to review the run folder with `tools/ui_review_prompt.md`. It gives each
picture a PASS, FAIL or UNSURE verdict, writes the description of each surface in
`testing/visual/descriptions.md`, and lists each defect once, to file as an issue.

The probe's own flags are in each `manifest-<tag>.json` (`problems`): text smaller than
it needs, controls overlapping, controls outside the window. They're measured, so treat
them as findings to confirm in the picture, not opinions.
