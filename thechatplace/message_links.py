"""The links in a session's messages (#190), for View, Links (Ctrl+L): a list
to open one in the browser, or copy it, without arrowing through the
conversation to find it.

A link is a Markdown link (``[words](address)``, an image's too), an address
in angle brackets, or a bare web address, in what you and Claude wrote. Links
in code (a fenced block or `inline code`) are listed too, marked as being in
code, since Claude often gives an address that way. Each address is listed
once, at its newest mention, newest first.

Only http, https and mailto links open, in the default browser, as the
formatted view's do (``rendering``), and links to sessions
(``thechatplace://session/<id>``, #144), which The Chat Place opens itself.
Anything else (a ``file:`` path, ``javascript:``) is listed so it can be
copied, and says why it won't open.

Nothing here imports wx, so it's all tested without a window.
