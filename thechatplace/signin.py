"""Whether Claude Code is signed in (#52), from ``claude auth status``.

That command answers in JSON, at once and at no cost:
``{"loggedIn": true, "authMethod": "claude.ai", "subscriptionType": "max",
"email": …, "orgName": …}``. Sessions on disk are listed either way; only
sending needs a sign-in. Signing in is ``claude auth login``, which opens
the browser, so it runs in its own window.
