"""The session list: where its entries come from, their state, and their order.

Two sources:

* **Desktop app sessions**, from the Claude desktop app's metadata files
  (``local_<id>.json``): its Code sessions and its Cowork sessions (#91).
  Read-only, always: The Chat Place never writes there.
* **The Chat Place's own sessions**, from its own store (``own_store``).

Live state comes from ``~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`` (``status`` busy or
idle) for desktop sessions, and from The Chat Place's own running turns for its
own sessions. The desktop app's ``postTurnSummary`` (``status_category``,
``needs_action``) decides "needs you" when present. All of it is undocumented,
so every field is read defensively and a file that will not parse is skipped.
