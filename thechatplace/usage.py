"""How full a session's context is, and how much of the plan's usage is
left (#19), as words.

Context comes from the token counts in Claude's latest reply (transcript, or
the turn's own result): input, cached input and output, the same sum Claude
Code records as a compaction's ``preTokens``. The window is what Claude Code
reported for that model in a turn of ours; or 1,000,000 once a session has
gone past 200,000 (a session can't use more than it has). Otherwise it isn't
known, and then no percentage is given and nothing is warned about: today's
models have both 200,000 and 1,000,000 windows, and guessing wrong would say
"80% full" of a session that's 16% full.

Usage limits come from the ``rate_limit_event`` a turn reports, e.g.
``{"status": "allowed", "rateLimitType": "five_hour", "resetsAt": 1791338400,
"unifiedWindows": {"five_hour": {"utilization": 0.08, "resetsAt": ...},
"seven_day": {"utilization": 0.34, "resetsAt": ...}}}``. Seen with Claude Code
2.1.286; read defensively.
