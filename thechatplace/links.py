"""Links to sessions (#144): ``thechatplace://session/<id>``.

Copy Session Link puts one on the clipboard, and following one (from the
command line, a Windows or Mac link, or a link in a message) brings The Chat
Place forward with that session selected and its messages loaded.

A link is only ever a way to find a session. Following one does what Enter
on the session does, and no more: it never sends a message, runs a turn or
changes a conversation, so a link from anywhere is safe to follow; anything
that isn't exactly the form below is refused.

The id in a link is the one that stays put for the life of the session:

* one of The Chat Place's own sessions: its Claude Code session id (the
  transcript's name, a UUID);
* a Claude desktop app session, Code or Cowork: the desktop app's own id
  (``local_...``), the one its claude:// links use;
* a session started in a terminal (#158): its Claude Code session id, as
  for The Chat Place's own.

Nothing here imports wx, so it's all tested without a window.
