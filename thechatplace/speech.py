"""Speak announcements through the user's screen reader or a system voice.

Adapted from Image Description Toolkit's ``shared/speech_engine.py`` (Kelly's
own code), which in turn bundles ClaudeSpeak's engine scripts. Changes for
The Chat Place: settings live in ``%APPDATA%/TheChatPlace/speech.json`` and
carry the announcement level (full / summary / silent) and whether turn
endings in every listed session are announced; the temp folder is
``thechatplace-speak``. Speech is on by default, through the screen reader
when one is running, because announcements are the point of this app.

On Windows, JAWS and NVDA are called from this process by
``screen_readers.py``, with NV Access's controller client bundled, because
NVDA doesn't install it and its absence sent every NVDA user to a Windows
voice (#98). When a screen reader is running, a Windows voice never speaks
over it. Windows voices, and VoiceOver and ``say`` on macOS, go through
ClaudeSpeak's engine scripts (TheWorkBench repo), bundled verbatim (IDT's
copy, with its middle-of-the-scale default rates):
``thechatplace/speech/speak-engine.ps1`` and ``speak-engine.sh``. This module
is the harness around them — settings, engine/voice enumeration, the
detached speaker process, and interruption by killing the previous speaker
before starting the next (the same process model ClaudeSpeak uses for its
Claude Code hook).

Design rules inherited from that investigation, kept on purpose:

* **Screen-reader routes never set voice or rate.** The user already chose
  those in JAWS/NVDA/VoiceOver; overriding them is an accessibility defect,
  not a feature.
* **Speech never blocks and never raises.** The speaker is a detached hidden
  process; a failure leaves at most ``last-route.log`` in the temp dir.
* **A clean exit only proves something spoke.** ``speech.log`` records which
  route took each screen-reader announcement, because a broken route falling
  back to a system voice is indistinguishable by ear (that's how #98 hid).

No wx imports here: the module is used by the wx app but testable without it.
