"""The Claude desktop app's own groups of Code sessions (#51), read-only.

The desktop app keeps them in ``claude_desktop_config.json``, beside its
``claude-code-sessions`` folder, under
``preferences.epitaxyPrefs["dframe-group-scopes"]``: one entry per
``<account>/<organisation>``, each with

- ``groups``: ``[{"id": "cg-…", "name": "IDT"}, …]``, in the app's order;
- ``assignments``: ``{"code:local_<id>": "cg-…"}``, a session's one group.

The Chat Place only reads this: the desktop app owns the file and rewrites it,
so its groups are changed in the desktop app. Anything unexpected (no file,
another shape after an update) just means no desktop groups.
