"""Running turns of The Chat Place's own sessions through the ``claude`` command.

Why the command line, and how it stays on the subscription
---------------------------------------------------------
``claude -p`` (print / headless mode) runs a turn under the same login as
the desktop app and the terminal: the subscription, never an API key. (Claude
plans count ``claude -p`` against a monthly Agent SDK credit; past it, turns
stop unless extra usage is on. usage.py reports the limits a turn sees.) The
things that would move a turn off the subscription are all ruled out here:

* **Never ``--bare``.** Bare mode skips the OAuth login and requires an API key.
* **A host session's variables don't reach the child.** If The Chat Place is
  started from inside a Claude Code session (a terminal tab in the desktop app,
  say), it inherits variables that session injected: ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``
  pointing at the desktop app's local proxy, ``CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_HAS_HOST_AUTH_REFRESH``
  and friends that tell the CLI a host will refresh its OAuth token. A child
  run with those waits on a token refresh that never comes (the lock seen
  during the investigation for issue #168). Those are removed by name
  (``SESSION_INJECTED_VARS``), as are the variables that would move billing
  off the subscription (``BILLING_VARS``: API keys, auth tokens, a different
  endpoint, Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry). Everything else is kept, including
  settings the user chose such as ``CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH``,
  ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR``, proxies and timeouts.
* **Permission prompts come to The Chat Place** (issues #187, #188), over the
  same pipes, with the control protocol the Agent SDK uses:
  ``--input-format stream-json --permission-prompts host
  --permission-prompt-tool stdio``. Anything that would ask arrives as a
  ``control_request`` (``can_use_tool``) and the turn waits until it is
  answered with a ``control_response``: allow (optionally with the input
  changed, which is how Claude's questions are answered), or deny with a
  reason Claude reads. Nothing is ever answered by timing out; Stop ends the
  turn. Claude's questions (AskUserQuestion) and plans (ExitPlanMode) come
  the same way. Checked against Claude Code 2.1.286.
* **The run is stopped if the CLI says it is using an API key.** The first
  stream-json event (``system/init``) reports ``apiKeySource``; on a
  subscription login it is ``"none"``. Anything else ends the turn before a
  request is made.

Never into a desktop session
----------------------------
Two clients resuming one session interleave their turns into one transcript.
So ``--resume`` is only ever built for a session in The Chat Place's own store,
and is refused for any id the desktop app knows about or any ``local_`` id
(``ResumeRefused``). That check lives in ``build_resume_command`` so no caller
can skip it.

Prompts go in on stdin, as a stream-json user message (UTF-8, the newlines
exactly as typed, escaped by JSON), not on the command line: a message that
begins with ``-`` cannot be mistaken for a flag, and there is no command-line
length limit. Stdin stays open for the turn, for answers to permission
requests, and is closed when the result arrives so the CLI exits. Output is
read as bytes and split only on newline bytes.
