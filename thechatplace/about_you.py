"""What Claude knows about you (View, What Claude Knows About You, #92).

Claude Code keeps what it knows about you in plain files: your instructions
(``CLAUDE.md``), the memories it saved for each project, your skills,
subagents, slash commands and output styles, and your settings. This module
finds them and describes each one in a line. It only reads; the dialog's Edit
button hands a file to your own editor, so The Chat Place never writes to
Claude Code's files.

The layout follows Claude Code's documented locations under ``~/.claude``
(``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` is honoured through ``platform_paths.claude_home``),
plus the project-level ones in the folders your sessions work in.
