"""Find in All Sessions (#109): which session did we talk about something in?

Each listed session's transcript is read (off the window's thread) and its
messages searched for the text, the whole text of each message, ignoring
case, as Find in Messages does. A match is the session, the message's time
and a snippet around the words. Sessions whose transcript isn't on disk,
or can't be read, are counted, so the result can say how many weren't
searched.

Nothing here imports wx, so it's all tested without a window.
