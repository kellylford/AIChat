"""Reporting a bug from inside the app (#28), modelled on QuickMail's.

The report is what you type (a summary, what happened, what you expected,
steps) plus a snapshot of non-sensitive facts about the app: versions, the
speech route and announcement level, which view and sort the list uses, and
how many sessions of each kind it lists. Never a session's title, folder,
message text, or anything that names a person or path: the report becomes a
public issue.

QuickMail sends reports through a small relay (a Cloudflare Worker holding a
GitHub App key), so nobody needs a GitHub account. The Chat Place has no relay
yet: the dialog opens a GitHub "new issue" page with the report filled in,
and copies the full report to the clipboard in case the page is cut short. A
relay would add a POST with a timeout, this page as the fallback, and its
rate-limit message.
