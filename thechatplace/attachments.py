"""Files and images sent with a message (#22).

Checked with Claude Code 2.1.286 in a headless turn:

* An image goes in the message itself, as a base64 image block next to the
  text: Claude read the words in a test picture exactly, and the transcript
  keeps it as an image block.
* Any other file is named in the text as ``@"C:\\path\\file.txt"``. Claude Code
  reads it into the message before Claude sees it: no tool call, no
  permission prompt, even outside the session's folder, and quoting works for
  paths with spaces.

Images bigger than the API takes (5 MB) go as ``@"path"`` too; Claude Code
then reads them with its own tools. A queued message (sent during a turn)
carries everything as ``@"path"``, because what's queued is text.
