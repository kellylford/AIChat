"""Notifications (#20), for when The Chat Place isn't the window you're in.

On a Mac each one is a macOS notification (wx's NotificationMessage, which
macOS shows under The Chat Place's name, or Python's from source) that
carries its own session: choosing any of them opens that session. macOS asks
once whether the app may send them. The rest of this describes Windows.

One notification-area icon, The Chat Place's own, created with the first
notification and removed when the app closes. Windows shows its balloons as
ordinary notifications: read by screen readers like any other, and quiet
under Do Not Disturb. A balloon click doesn't say which balloon it was, so
only the latest one's session is kept: choosing it calls ``on_click`` with
that key, and choosing the icon itself calls it with None (just come
forward).

Deliberately not wx's NotificationMessage: it shares a temporary icon whose
hidden window can keep the app running after it closes, and it can send a
click to the wrong notification.
