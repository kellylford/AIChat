"""Name controls for VoiceOver, which wx can't do on macOS (from Image
Description Toolkit's shared/mac_accessibility.py), and make the app active
so VoiceOver finds its menu bar (``activate_app``).

Measured on wxPython 4.3.1 / wxWidgets 3.3.3: ``SetAccessible()`` raises
``NotImplementedError`` (``wx.Accessible`` is Windows-only), and ``SetName()``
reaches nothing native. Every ``wx.TextCtrl``, ``wx.ListBox`` and ``wx.Choice``
reports ``accessibilityLabel == nil`` however it was named, so VoiceOver read
an edit box's contents and never its label. Buttons and check boxes are fine
without help: AppKit names them from their title.

So the label is set on the native view through NSAccessibility, with ctypes
rather than PyObjC, which isn't a dependency and would be a lot to add to the
app bundle for three selectors.

``GetHandle()`` isn't always the view VoiceOver lands on. A multi-line
``wx.TextCtrl`` is a scroll view around an ``NSTextView``, and a ``wx.ListBox``
a scroll view around an ``NSTableView``. VoiceOver focuses the inner view, so
when the handle has a ``documentView``, that is what gets the label.

This module doesn't import wx, so its logic can be tested anywhere, and
everything in it is a no-op off macOS.
