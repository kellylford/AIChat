The Chat Place $VERSION
=======================

A keyboard and screen reader friendly home for your Claude Code chats.

To install, drag $APP_NAME onto Applications, then open it from
Applications (or with Spotlight: Cmd+Space, "The Chat Place").

You need Claude Code installed and signed in to a Claude subscription
(https://claude.com/claude-code). The Chat Place never uses an API key.

The Chat Place updates itself, wherever you keep it: it says when a new
version is out, and Help, Check for Updates installs it. Your sessions and
settings are in ~/Library/Application Support/TheChatPlace and are kept.
README
if [ "$SIGNED" != "signed" ]; then
    cat >> "$STAGING/README.txt" <<'README'

This build isn't signed by Apple, so the first time you open it macOS says it
can't check it. Open System Settings, Privacy & Security, scroll to Security,
and choose Open Anyway next to The Chat Place; then open it again.
