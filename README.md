# The Chat Place

A home for your Claude Code chats: an accessible companion for Claude Code.

The Chat Place is an independent project by Kelly Ford. It works with Claude Code and the
Claude desktop app, but it isn't made, sponsored or endorsed by Anthropic, and isn't affiliated
with it. Claude and Claude Code are trademarks of Anthropic.

New to The Chat Place? The [user guide](https://kellylford.github.io/AIChat/user-guide.html) starts
with the everyday things and goes deeper; it's also in the app, under Help, User Guide. This README
has the full details.

Keyboard shortcuts: [a web page](https://kellylford.github.io/AIChat/keyboard-shortcuts.html), also as
[Markdown](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) and [plain text](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.txt): the same list
as Help, Keyboard Shortcuts (F1) in the app.

> **Status: version 0.1.5, a pre-release** (0.1.0, the first release, came out on 7 October 2026). Used with JAWS on Kelly's PC; the
> installer, uninstaller and update check have been tested in the vmtest VM. Downloading and
> installing an update needs two published releases, so it is first tried with 0.1.1. It has not
> yet had a pass with NVDA. The Mac build is used with VoiceOver on Kelly's Mac, and since 0.1.2
> the release workflow signs and notarizes it.

A keyboard and screen reader friendly reader for Claude Code sessions. It lists every session the
Claude desktop app has open, and the ones you started by typing `claude` in a terminal, shows each
one as a conversation you can arrow through, tells you when a session answers, and switches the
desktop app to a session when you need the real thing.
It can also start sessions of its own, which you can read and reply to entirely from here.

It runs on your existing Claude subscription, signed in to Claude Code, and never uses an API
key. Its own sessions' turns are Claude Code turns in headless mode (`claude -p`). Anthropic's
help article [Use the Claude Agent SDK with your Claude plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan)
says those count against a monthly credit; past it, turns stop unless you've turned on extra
usage, which is billed. View, Usage and Context (Ctrl+Shift+U) shows where you
stand. Reading the desktop app's sessions costs nothing.

## What it does

One window, three parts, in Tab order: the **session list**, the **messages** of the loaded
session, and the **reply box** with Send and Stop. Shift+Tab goes back the same way, and the
session list is always there. **F6** and **Shift+F6** move between those parts and the **status
bar**, which holds whatever was said last ("12 sessions: 1 need you", "Claude is using Bash.") in
a read-only box to read by line, word and character; **Ctrl+9** goes straight there. The status
bar isn't a Tab stop, and your screen reader's own read-status-bar key still works.

- **Session list.** Each item reads its title, its repo folder, its state (needs you, working or
  idle), and when it was last active: "Fix the release build, QuickMail, needs you: Choose a
  version number, active 1 minute ago". By default sessions that need you come first, then
  working ones, then the rest, newest first. **View, Sort Sessions** (Alt+V, O) chooses another
  order: by status (that default), newest first, oldest first, by title, or by folder (A to Z,
  newest first within one title or folder). The choice is remembered, and choosing it reorders
  the list at once, keeping you on the same session. The list refreshes itself every five
  seconds. While you're in the list, rows don't move: a changed session is updated where it is
  and a new one is added at the end. F5, or a refresh while you're elsewhere, puts it back in
  order, keeping you on the same session.
  **View, Show Sessions** (Alt+V, H) chooses which sessions are listed: all, needs you or
  working, needs you, working, with a new reply (a Chat Place session whose reply you haven't
  loaded yet), idle, desktop app sessions (Code and Cowork), just Cowork sessions, The Chat
  Place's own, terminal sessions, Remote Control sessions (desktop app sessions linked for Remote Control, and Chat
  Place sessions you've turned it on for or that have connected), ungrouped (in none of your
  groups or the desktop app's), archived (the desktop app's archived sessions, otherwise
  hidden), hidden (the ones you've hidden), or one of your groups. The list's name says what it
  shows and how many ("Session list, needs you, 2 of 139"), and the choice is remembered.
  Choosing one keeps you on the same session when it's still listed.
  **View, Session List Columns** (Alt+V, E) chooses what each line says and in what order, so
  it can start with the status rather than the title. The columns are Title, Folder,
  Status, New reply, Last activity, Kind (Chat Place, Cowork or terminal), Remote Control, Archived,
  Hidden and Groups, all shown at first, and **Last message**, which isn't shown until you add
  it; a column with nothing to say for a session is left out of its line. Last message says
  where each conversation ended without loading it: "Claude:" or "You:" and the start of the
  last message either of you wrote, as plain text on one line (about 150 characters, cut at a
  word with "…"; a link reads as its words, a bare web address as its site). Tool calls and their results don't count. Press Enter to load the session and
  read the whole message. A session whose conversation is missing or can't be read says nothing
  there. Only the end of each conversation file is read, in the background, and again only when
  the file has changed; nothing is read while the column isn't shown. While a session is working,
  the line you're on keeps its last message until the status changes, so a screen reader doesn't
  read it again each time Claude writes; other lines change at once. The
  dialog has Available columns and Shown columns (in the order they're read), with Add, Remove,
  Move Up, Move Down, Move to Top, Move to Bottom and Reset to Default, and a preview of the
  selected session's line. Enter in Available adds a column, Delete in Shown removes one (on a
  Mac, Delete or Fn+Delete), and
  Alt+Up, Alt+Down, Alt+Home and Alt+End in Shown move it (Option on a Mac); each is said
  ("Status moved to top, 1 of 10") and you stay on the column you moved. OK saves the choice
  in The Chat Place's settings and rewrites the list at once; Escape cancels. With Status first,
  typing a letter no longer jumps to a title (nor with Last message first, where lines start
  with "Claude" or "You"); Ctrl+F still finds a session by title or folder.
  Arrowing doesn't load anything; **Enter loads that session** into the messages list, moves you
  there, and says "Loaded Quiet one, 12 messages."
- **Hide or delete a session.** **Delete** (File, Hide Session) takes the selected session out of
  the list without changing it; View, Show Sessions, Hidden lists hidden sessions, and File, Bring
  Back Session returns one. **Shift+Delete** (File, Delete Session Permanently) deletes one of The
  Chat Place's own sessions for good, from any view, hidden or not: after you confirm (No is the
  default), its Claude Code transcript is deleted from the computer and it leaves the list, its
  groups and the hidden list. It waits while the session is working, here or in a terminal.
  Desktop app sessions can only be hidden; delete those in the desktop app.
  On a Mac laptop these are Fn+Delete and Fn+Shift+Delete (the forward-delete key).
- **Rename a session** (F2, File, Rename Session, or the session's menu). One of The Chat
  Place's own sessions is renamed outright. A desktop app session's new name shows only in The
  Chat Place, since its files are never changed: it's kept in
  `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\titles.json`, and the desktop app keeps its own name for it. Renaming
  it to nothing (clear the box) goes back to the desktop app's name.
- **The session's menu** (Applications key or Shift+F10 in the session list, VO+Shift+M with
  VoiceOver on a Mac, or a right-click) has the File menu's commands for the selected session:
  load, open in Claude, continue here, rename, Remote Control, groups, export, and hide or delete.
- **What Claude knows about you** (Ctrl+Shift+K, View, What Claude Knows About You). Claude Code
  keeps what it knows about you in plain files, and this lists them by kind: your instructions
  (`CLAUDE.md`, yours and each project's), the memories Claude saved for each project, your
  skills (including ones synced from your account), subagents, slash commands, output styles and
  settings. It includes the project-level ones in the folders your sessions work in. Pick a kind,
  arrow through its items (each with its description), and Enter reads the file in a box you can
  move through by line. **Edit in Your Editor** opens the file in your own editor (on Windows,
  the program set to edit that kind of file, or Notepad); The Chat Place itself never writes to
  Claude Code's files. Reload shows your changes; Show in Folder and Copy Path find the file.
  Not listed yet: what plugins add, `CLAUDE.md` files in a project's parent folders,
  `.claude/rules`, and an organization's managed settings.
- **Find** (Ctrl+F, View, Find). In the session list it asks for some text and shows only
  sessions whose title, folder or "needs you" note contains it, within the current view; the
  list's name says so ("Session list, matching \"build\", 3 of 139") and Escape shows them
  all again. In the messages it finds the next message containing the text, searching each
  message's whole text, not just the first line you see; F3 and Shift+F3 find the next and
  previous, going round from the other end when they reach one (and saying so).
- **Groups**, like groups in Claude on the web: **Ctrl+G** (File, Add to Group) puts the
  selected session in a group, or a new one; File, Remove from Group takes it out; File,
  Manage Groups lists your groups with how many sessions each has, to make, rename or delete
  them (deleting a group never touches its sessions). A session can be in several groups, and
  its row says which ("…, group Work"). The Chat Place's groups are kept in
  `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\groups.json`; the desktop app's files are never changed.
  The **desktop app's own groups** show too: in View, Show Sessions, in each session's row,
  and in Add to Group. They're read from the desktop app's settings each refresh, so a change
  there shows here; they're changed in the desktop app. Adding one of The Chat Place's sessions
  to a desktop app group keeps a Chat Place group of the same name, shown together with it.
- **What "needs you" means.** For a Claude desktop app session: it isn't working right now (it can
  still be open in the desktop app), and the desktop
  app's summary of its latest turn says it's waiting on you, either with a "needs action" note
  (read after "needs you:") or a status such as blocked, needs input or review ready. The desktop
  app doesn't write that summary after every turn, so a session can be waiting on you and still
  show as idle. For one of The Chat Place's own sessions: Claude is waiting right now for a
  permission, a question or a plan (Ctrl+Shift+A), which ends when you answer; or its last turn
  failed, or tools were refused in it, which is saved with the session and lasts, even across a
  restart, until its next turn starts.
- **Messages:** newest last, with focus on the newest. Each row shows "You:" or "Claude:" and its
  first line, but your screen reader reads the **whole message** as you arrow onto it, as words
  (headings and list items as sentences, and each code block as what it is: "Code block, Python, 14
  lines"). Settings, Reading messages turns that off, to hear just the first line. The list's name
  says the session's state and whether it's read-only. **Enter** (or the context menu's Read Full
  Message, with the Applications key, Shift+F10, VO+Shift+M or a right-click) shows the whole
  message as a formatted page, so your screen reader's browse mode moves by heading (H), table (T,
  then its cell commands), list (L) and code block (each is a region: R in JAWS, D in NVDA, named
  like "Code block, Python, 14 lines"). Links open in your browser. **Read as Plain Text** (Alt+P)
  switches to a read-only text box, to read by line, word and character, and Settings can make that
  the default. Escape closes either, back on the same message. The page needs Microsoft's Edge
  WebView2 runtime, which comes with Windows 11; without it, the text box opens. Nothing in the
  page is fetched from the internet, and HTML in a message is shown as text, never run. **Code
  Blocks** (**Ctrl+Shift+B**, or on the context menu) lists the message's code blocks by language
  and size, with the selected one's code in a box to read by line (Enter on a block goes there) and
  a Copy button for just that block; **Ctrl+Shift+C** copies the message's last code block straight
  away. Question cards read as "Claude asked: Which version?" with the options in the full text,
  then "You answered: ...". Refused tools read "Permission denied: ...". Tool calls and tool
  results are hidden unless you turn on Show Tool Activity (Ctrl+T). It's set for each session and
  remembered, so turning it on for one session leaves the others as they were. With it on, the open session's
  tool calls are also **spoken as they happen**, so a long turn isn't silent: "Using Bash: git
  status; Read: main.py." In The Chat Place's own sessions, what Claude writes between tool calls
  ("Let me check the build.") is spoken too. A run of calls is gathered for a moment and said
  together, counted when there are many ("Using Read 4 times, then Bash."), and never cuts off your
  screen reader. At the summary level tools are always counted; at silent only the status bar shows
  them. Tool results aren't spoken. New messages arrive at the end without moving you.
- **Reply box:** for The Chat Place's own sessions, type and press Ctrl+Enter (or Send). You stay in
  the reply box. For a desktop app or terminal session the same place holds a read-only note
  saying where you reply, with Open in Claude and Continue Here as they apply.
- **Escape** in the messages or the reply box (or Backspace in the messages) goes back to the
  session list, on the same session. Enter there on the session that's already loaded takes you
  back to its messages where you left them, without reloading.
- **Commands and skills** (Ctrl+/, the Commands button after Stop, or File, Insert Command
  or Skill), in The Chat Place's own
  sessions: a searchable list of your skills and custom commands, then Claude Code's own
  (/compact, /context, /code-review and the rest), each with its description and what it
  takes. Type to filter by name or description, Down to the list, Enter to choose: it goes
  at the start of the reply box ("/compact "), replacing a command already there and keeping
  what you typed, ready to finish and send. The list is Claude Code's own for the session's
  folder, asked for in the background when the session loads (no turn, no cost) and kept
  current by each turn. If it isn't there yet, you hear "Commands are ready" when it is; the list
  never opens by itself.
- **Prompts** (Ctrl+Shift+P, File, Prompts): a library of messages you send often, each with a
  name. The dialog lists them by name, with the selected one's text below to read (Alt+X). **Use**
  (or Enter on a prompt) closes it and puts the prompt in the reply box of the loaded Chat Place
  session: in place of an empty reply, or at the cursor in what you've typed (replacing any text
  you've selected), ready to change and send. **New** and **Edit** ask for a name and the text (Enter starts a new line in the text;
  Ctrl+Enter saves), **Delete** (or Delete on a prompt) asks first, and **Move Up** and **Move
  Down** put them in the order you want. Each change is saved at once and spoken ("Prompt saved:
  Review", "Prompt deleted: Review"); Close or Escape closes. To save something as you send it,
  press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** in the reply box (File, Send and Save as Prompt): it asks for a name,
  starting with the message's first few words, saves the prompt and then sends the message as
  Ctrl+Enter does. Escape at the name does neither, and leaves your message in the reply box.
  Prompts are kept in `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\prompts.json`. The Chat Place doesn't read Claude
  Code's own history of what you've typed.
- **Attachments**, in The Chat Place's own sessions: **Attach Files** (Alt+T, after Commands;
  Ctrl+Shift+F) adds files and images to your next message, and **Ctrl+V** in the reply box
  attaches a picture on the clipboard, such as a screenshot from Win+Shift+S. They're listed
  under the reply box ("2 attachments: screenshot.png, log.txt"); Delete there removes one.
  Images go to Claude as images, so it can describe what's on screen; other files are named
  in the message as `@"path"`, which Claude Code reads in for Claude. A message can be
  just attachments. Each session keeps its own until they're sent. Pasted pictures are saved
  in `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\pasted images`.
- **Export** (Ctrl+E, File, Export Session) saves the selected session's conversation,
  or the loaded one's, to a file: **Markdown**, a **web page** (formatted like the full-message
  view, nothing fetched from the internet) or **plain text**, chosen by the Save as type list
  or the file name's extension. Each message is a heading ("Claude, 10:43") and its text as
  written, with the message's own headings moved down two levels so the file's outline stays
  session, message, section. Tool activity is included when Show Tool Activity is on. It
  starts in Documents, named after the session and the date, works in the background (a long
  session never freezes the window), and says where it saved; the status bar keeps that to read
  back. Headings carry the time, and the date whenever the day changes.
- **Open in Claude** (Ctrl+O) switches the desktop app to the session, for approving a permission
  prompt or answering a question card in a desktop app session.
- **Copy Session Link** (Ctrl+Shift+L, File menu, or the session's menu) copies a link to the
  selected session, to paste into a note, an email or another session. A list offers the links that
  apply, best first; Enter on the first copies a Markdown link, `[Title](thechatplace://session/…)`,
  that opens the session in The Chat Place. Below it are a desktop app session's Open in Claude link
  (`claude://…`) and, for one of The Chat Place's sessions on Remote Control, its claude.ai address,
  each as a Markdown link and then as the bare link. What was copied is said. Following a
  `thechatplace://` link (from a note, Win+R or Terminal's `open`, a link in a message's formatted
  view) brings The Chat Place forward, starting it if it isn't running, selects the session, loads
  its messages and puts you in them, as choosing it yourself does. If the list's view or search
  leaves the session out, it shows all sessions (or Archived or Hidden) and says so. A link only
  ever finds a session, as Enter on it does: it never sends a message, runs a turn or changes a
  conversation, and anything that isn't exactly a link to a session gets "That link isn't one The
  Chat Place knows." A session's link uses the id that lasts: the Claude Code session id for The
  Chat Place's own sessions, the desktop app's `local_…` id for its Code and Cowork sessions. On
  Windows the installed copy registers `thechatplace://` for your user account
  (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\thechatplace`) when it's installed and at start, and
  uninstalling removes it; the portable copy and a source run never register. On a Mac the app
  declares the link type itself. When The Chat Place is already running, the copy a link starts
  hands the link over (as a small file in its own data folder, `links`, taken within a second) and
  closes.
- **Cowork sessions.** The desktop app's Cowork sessions are listed too, read-only, as desktop app
  sessions are. Each row says "Cowork session", and in place of a repo folder it names the folder
  you gave Cowork to work on, or says "no folder" if there isn't one. View, Show Sessions, Cowork
  Sessions lists only them, and Ctrl+F in the list finds them by "Cowork". Enter reads the
  conversation, and Open in Claude switches the desktop app to it. Whether the list can tell that
  a Cowork session is working (and so announce its finished turn) depends on the version of
  Claude Code the desktop app runs it with: older ones don't record it. They can't be continued
  here (see Limitations), so Continue Here isn't offered for them, and on the session menu it's
  unavailable. The desktop app's Chat conversations are kept on Anthropic's servers rather than on
  your PC, so they aren't listed.
- **Terminal sessions.** Sessions you started by typing `claude` in a terminal are listed too,
  read-only, as desktop app sessions are. Each row says "terminal session" and names the folder
  you started it in. Its title is the name you gave it with `/rename`, or else the one Claude Code
  gave it, or else the start of your first message. View, Show Sessions, Terminal Sessions lists
  only them, and Ctrl+F in the list finds them by "terminal". Enter reads the conversation.
  Claude often makes many tool calls in a terminal session: they're hidden unless you turn on Show
  Tool Activity (Ctrl+T), which also speaks each one as it happens, and Ctrl+T hides them again. The
  list shows one as working while Claude works in it, and as needing you while it waits on you in
  the terminal (a permission or a question), and both are announced. You reply to it in its
  terminal, or carry it on here with Continue Here; Open in Claude isn't offered, since the
  desktop app doesn't list it. Sessions run by scripts with `claude -p`, and those of the VS Code
  extension, aren't listed.
- **Continue Here** (Ctrl+Shift+N, or the Continue Here button after that note) carries a desktop
  app or terminal session on in The Chat Place, as a copy: a new Chat Place session in the same
  folder, with the whole conversation so far in its messages, that you reply to here. You type its
  first message in the same dialog as New Session; the title starts as "<title> (continued)". The
  original session isn't changed, and what you do in the copy doesn't appear in it.
- **New Session** (Ctrl+N) starts a session of The Chat Place's own: choose a folder, a title,
  the model (Alt+D), the effort (Alt+E), a permission mode (auto by default; accept edits, manual
  and plan are offered) and the first message. The models are Default (your Claude Code setting), Opus,
  Sonnet and Haiku, each the latest of its family. The model is kept with the session and
  passed to every turn. Arriving in the messages, you hear it ("Messages in Build (idle, on
  Opus)"). Fable isn't offered: on some plans it bills to usage credits, and in the headless
  mode The Chat Place uses, Claude Code does that without asking. So if a turn would run on
  Fable anyway (Claude Code's own default, or a fallback), The Chat Place stops it before
  anything is sent and says why. **File, Change Model** changes a session's model from its
  next turn. **Effort** is Default (your Claude Code setting), Low, Medium, High, Extra high or
  Max, passed to every turn as Claude Code's `--effort`; models that don't support effort levels
  ignore it. **File, Change Effort** (Alt+F, F) and **File, Change Permission Mode**
  (Ctrl+Shift+O) change them from the next turn: the list starts on the current choice, marked
  "(now)", and you hear, for example, "Permission mode for Build: plan, from its next turn." A
  turn that's running carries on as it started. The session's heading says its model, and its
  effort and mode when they aren't the defaults ("on Opus at high effort, plan mode"). For desktop app and terminal sessions these are set
  in Claude or the terminal, and the items say so. If that first message never reaches Claude (Claude Code not signed in, say), it goes
  back into the reply box and Send starts the session again.
- **Where a new session works** (#154). The Folder box starts at the folder used most recently,
  and its list (Up and Down Arrow on Windows, or open it with Alt+Down Arrow) is every folder
  your sessions have used, The Chat Place's and the desktop app's, newest first: a worktree
  counts as its repository, and Cowork sessions and folders that no longer exist are left out
  (if checking takes more than a moment, as for a network drive that's gone, the list is offered
  unchecked). Browse (Alt+B) still opens a folder dialog. **From GitHub** (Alt+G) lists your
  repositories with `gh repo list` (the GitHub CLI's own sign-in; The Chat Place keeps no token)
  and says how many there are, or in the list why it couldn't get them. Type to filter, or type
  owner/name or a GitHub address for exactly that repository; Enter uses it. A repository
  already in your GitHub folder (checked by its origin) is used as it is; otherwise
  `gh repo clone` clones it in the background into a temporary folder beside it, renamed only
  when the clone has worked. Cancel ends gh and the git it started, and removes only that
  temporary folder; a folder of the repository's name that isn't the repository is never
  touched. Clones go into the GitHub folder (in your home folder or in Documents), made if
  there isn't one. **Work in** (Alt+I) is The folder as it is (naming its branch) or A new
  worktree, which a folder outside a git repository can't have (choosing it says so). **Branch**
  (Alt+R) lists the local branches no worktree has checked out; choose one, type the name of a
  branch only a remote has (the new branch tracks it), or type a new name to branch from what
  the folder has checked out. Start makes the worktree in the background with `git worktree
  add`, in `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<branch>` where Claude Code and the desktop app put theirs
  (beside them even when the folder is a worktree itself), and starts the session in the same
  folder inside it as the one chosen. If git doesn't already ignore `.claude/worktrees/`, it's
  added to the repository's own `.git/info/exclude` (never shared), so worktrees don't show as
  new files. The worktree is left in place afterwards. Continue Here keeps its session's own
  folder, so it has none of these. git and gh are run with no shell and never prompt; branch and
  repository names are checked before either sees them. On a Mac without Apple's Command Line
  Tools, `/usr/bin/git` isn't used, since running it asks to install them.
- **Remote Control.** Settings can turn on Remote Control for The Chat Place's sessions, and
  **File, Remote Control** turns it on or off for one session (or back to the Settings
  default). A session on Remote Control can be reached from claude.ai and your other devices
  while one of its turns is running: each turn is its own Claude Code process, so between turns
  it shows as offline. The same Remote Control session is joined every turn, and File, Remote
  Control copies its claude.ai address. Turning it on copies the conversation to claude.ai,
  where it stays (turning Remote Control off, or deleting the session, doesn't remove it;
  archive it on claude.ai). While a turn runs, anyone signed in to your account on claude.ai
  can type into it or answer its questions; a question answered there is cleared here.
  It's also on the session's menu (Applications key). A session on Remote Control says so in
  its row and heading, and View, Show Sessions, Remote Control Sessions lists it (with only the
  Settings default on, a Chat Place session's row says so once it has connected). For a Claude
  desktop app session, File, Remote Control offers to open it in the desktop app, where its
  Remote Control is turned on, or to continue it here as a copy with Remote Control on from the
  first turn; The Chat Place never changes the desktop app's session itself.
- **Other machines (File, Other Machines, Ctrl+Shift+M).** Your Claude Code sessions on
  your other computers, reached through Claude in the loaded Chat Place session, which needs
  Remote Control on (as do they). It lists them from Claude's latest look: their names and
  whether each is idle, busy or offline. "Offline" often only means between turns, and a
  message waits for it. **Refresh the list** asks Claude to look again, as a turn in the
  session, and the list is there next time you press Ctrl+Shift+M. Choose a session, type
  your message, and Claude sends it word for word; its reply comes back to the same session.
  Only Claude can reach other computers, and only what they send back can be shown: their
  own conversations can't be read from here. It works between turns, not during one.
- **Messages from other sessions.** Claude can also send a message to another Claude Code
  session when you ask in your own words, for example "send the session called Mac Hub a
  message asking for its hostname". A message that comes back shows in the messages list as **From** and the
  session's name ("From Mac Hub: ..."), not as something you typed, and it's announced in
  any open session. Other sessions reach a Chat Place session by its title, which stays the
  same every turn, so rename it to something they can find. A Chat Place session only acts on
  a message during one of its turns, so a message that arrives between turns waits for the
  next one. The other computer's own conversation can't be read from here; only what its
  Claude sends back.
- **Claude asks, you answer.** In The Chat Place's own sessions, when Claude needs permission
  for something the permission mode doesn't allow, asks you a question, or has a plan for you
  to approve, the turn waits for you. It's announced ("Build needs you. Claude wants to run
  git push. Ctrl+Shift+A answers."), and the session shows as needing you in the list.
  **Ctrl+Shift+A** opens the answer:
  - **Permission:** the whole request (the command, or the file and what would change) to
    read by line, then **Allow**, **Allow for this session** (shown when Claude Code suggests
    a rule, and named in full, such as "don't ask again this session for Bash(git push:*)"),
    or **Deny**, which is the default button and can carry a reason Claude reads.
  - **Questions:** each question is a group of options with their descriptions, with Other
    and a box to type your own answer; Send Answers, or Don't Answer.
  - **Plan:** the plan to read (Read Formatted shows it as a page, by heading), then **Approve**, choosing the mode to carry on in (accept
    edits, auto or manual), or **Keep Planning** with what to change, which is the default.

  Escape in any of them answers later; nothing is approved or refused by waiting. "For this
  session" lasts for the session, not just the turn: The Chat Place keeps the rule with the
  session and gives it to every later turn. It never writes Claude Code's settings files.
- **Announcements.** When the open session gets a new reply, or one of The Chat Place's sessions
  finishes a turn, or any listed session stops working, it's announced through your screen reader
  (or a system voice when no screen reader is running) and put on the status bar. Settings (Ctrl+Comma) chooses full (the whole
  reply), summary (the session's name and the first sentence) or silent (status bar only), whether
  every listed session is announced or just the open one, and the speech route; its Reading
  messages group chooses whether full messages open as a formatted page or plain text.
  Ctrl+Shift+R repeats the last announcement.
- **Which voice speaks.** On Windows, Automatic (the default) speaks through JAWS or NVDA,
  whichever is running, in your screen reader's own voice and rate. NVDA needs nothing extra: The
  Chat Place ships NV Access's NVDA Controller Client. A system voice is used only when no screen
  reader is running in your Windows session. If one is running but can't be reached (or takes
  more than 3 seconds to answer), The Chat Place doesn't talk over it in another voice. Instead,
  the status bar shows the announcement with the reason beside it, a Windows notification says
  announcements aren't being spoken (unless notifications are off), and Settings shows a Speech
  problem box after the speech engine. Each new reason is reported once, until speech works
  again. Nothing is spoken through a screen reader while Windows is locked. Choosing JAWS or NVDA in
  Settings only decides which is tried first when both are running. On a Mac, Automatic speaks
  through VoiceOver when it's running, else a system voice.
- **The status bar** (F6, or Ctrl+9) has parts, as in QuickMail, and Left and Right move between
  them: what was last said, then the loaded session and what it's doing (read-only text), then
  buttons that appear when there's something to act on: how full the context is (Usage and
  Context), how many sessions need you (goes to the first), and an available update. Tab leaves
  the status bar. Your screen reader's read-status-bar key reads all the parts.
- **Answers to what you do are spoken too**, briefly and without cutting off your screen reader:
  "Tool activity shown in Build.", "Message copied.", and so on (unless announcements are set to silent).
- **Your own message is read back when it's sent**, so you hear what actually went to Claude,
  and where: "Sent to Hub probe: Fix the build." During a turn it's "Queued for Hub probe: …",
  and when the queued message goes out you hear only "Sent your queued message", not the
  message again. It follows the announcement level: at full, the message up to about 300
  characters, then "… and 412 more words"; at summary, its first sentence; at silent, nothing.
  Markdown is read as words: a code block is "Code block omitted", and headings and list items
  are read as separate sentences. Turn it off in Settings with "Read your own messages back when
  they're sent" (Alt+M), and you hear just "Sent. Hub probe is working."
- **Notifications** while you're in another window: when one of The Chat Place's own
  sessions finishes a turn, fails or needs you (a permission or a question), when a desktop app
  session starts needing you, and when the loaded session finishes. Choosing one brings
  The Chat Place forward with that session loaded. Settings, Windows notifications (on a Mac,
  Notifications) chooses every finished turn of its own sessions (the default), only when a
  session needs you, or off. While you're in The Chat Place (or one of its dialogs), the
  announcement is enough and none are shown.
  - On Windows they're ordinary Windows notifications from The Chat Place's icon in the
    notification area: read by your screen reader, and quiet under Do Not Disturb. Choosing the
    icon itself brings The Chat Place forward.
  - On a Mac they're macOS notifications, in Notification Center and under Focus like any other.
    macOS asks once whether The Chat Place may send them (System Settings, Notifications changes
    that). Each one remembers its own session, so choosing an older one still opens the right
    session.
- **Changed Files** (Ctrl+Shift+D, View menu) lists the files Claude changed since your latest
  message, or in the whole session, each with its line counts ("main_frame.py, 40 lines added, 12
  removed, in thechatplace\ui"). Enter on a file reads its changes in a text box, a line at a
  time: where each change is, then "Removed:", "Added:" and "Unchanged:" lines. It's built from the
  transcript, so it works for desktop app sessions too, with no git needed. Changes made by a
  subagent Claude hands work to, and notebook edits, aren't counted yet. When the loaded
  session's turn ends, the announcement (at the full level) is followed by a one-line summary:
  "Changed 3 files: main_frame.py, 40 lines added, 12 removed; …".
- **Usage and Context** (Ctrl+Shift+U, View menu) opens a list to read with the arrow keys: first
  how full the loaded session's context is ("Quiet one: Context 62% full: 124,000 of 200,000
  tokens"), then each of your plan's usage limits on a line of its own. When something isn't known
  yet, the line says so. Copy (Alt+C), or Ctrl+C in the list, copies the selected line, and Copy
  All (Alt+A) copies every line; Escape or Close (Alt+L) closes it. The context comes from the token counts of Claude's latest
  reply (the percentage only once the window's size is known: Claude Code reports it for a model
  when one of The Chat Place's sessions runs a turn on it, and a session past 200,000 tokens has the
  1,000,000 window), and the limits are as the latest turn reported them ("5-hour limit 8% used,
  resets at 10:00 AM.", then "Weekly limit 34% used, resets on Friday at 9:00 AM.").
  It's said once, unasked, when the loaded session's context passes 80%, when a limit passes
  90% or is reached, and when Claude Code compacts a conversation (the messages list shows
  "Conversation compacted" too). A turn that fails on a usage limit says so in plain words,
  with when it resets.
- **Turn Status** (Ctrl+Shift+T) says how long Claude has been working on the current turn and
  what it last did, or, while Claude waits on background work, what is still running. There's no
  time limit on a turn; Stop (Ctrl+Period) ends it, along with anything it started, such as a
  build.
- **User Guide** (Help menu, Alt+H, G) shows the user guide as a page, read by heading like the
  keyboard shortcuts, or as plain text (Alt+P). It's part of the app, so it works offline. It's
  edited in `thechatplace/assets/user-guide.md`; `python tools/make_docs.py` makes the copies in
  `docs/`.
- **Claude Code Sign-in** (Help menu) says whether Claude Code is signed in, to which plan and
  as whom ("Claude Code is signed in to your Claude Max plan as …"). If it isn't, it offers to
  sign in: `claude auth login` opens in its own window (a Terminal window on a Mac) and your
  browser shows Claude's sign-in page; when you've finished, The Chat Place checks again and
  says the result. If Claude Code isn't installed, or only an old npm install is, it says so,
  gives the install command, and offers to run Claude Code's native installer in its own
  window, then checks again once it's done. If Claude Code is there but can't be asked, it says
  why: no answer in 20 seconds, couldn't be started, too old (`claude update` fixes that), or
  what it printed. The Chat Place also checks at start-up and says so only if there's a problem.
  Your sessions are listed whether or not Claude Code is signed in (they're read from disk);
  only sending a message needs a sign-in.
- **Report a Bug** (Help menu) asks for a summary, what happened, what you expected and the
  steps, and shows exactly what else the report includes before it goes anywhere: versions
  (The Chat Place, Windows, Python, wxPython, Claude Code), the announcement level and speech
  engine, what happened to the last announcement (which screen reader spoke it, or why none
  did), the list's view and sort, and how many sessions it lists. Never a session's title,
  folder or messages. **Open on GitHub** copies the whole report and opens GitHub's new-issue
  page with it filled in; **Copy Report** only copies it. Filing on GitHub needs access to the
  repository; anyone else can Copy Report and email it to support@theideaplace.net.

## Install

You need Windows 10 or 11, or a Mac with Apple silicon, and **Claude Code installed with its
native installer and signed in** to a Claude subscription (the `claude` command, the same login
the desktop app uses). The Claude desktop app's own copy of Claude Code isn't on the PATH and
isn't meant for other programs, so install the command as well, from a terminal:

- Mac: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
- Windows PowerShell: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
- Windows Command Prompt:
  `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd`

Then run `claude` once to sign in. Help, Claude Code Sign-in can run the installer and the
sign-in for you. Homebrew (`brew install --cask claude-code`) and WinGet
(`winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode`) installs work too.

**Windows.** Download `TheChatPlace-windows-Setup.exe` from the newest release on
[the releases page](https://github.com/kellylford/AIChat/releases) and run it.
It installs for you only, with no administrator rights, adds The Chat Place to the Start menu, and
starts it. The portable zip from the same release runs without installing, but doesn't update
itself.

The app is built for x64; Arm PCs run it under Windows's x64 emulation.

**Mac.** Download `TheChatPlace-macos-arm64.dmg` from the same release, open it, and drag
The Chat Place onto Applications (or anywhere you like: it updates itself wherever it is). The
disk image is signed and notarized, so it opens without a warning. The first time speech goes through VoiceOver, macOS asks whether The Chat Place may
control VoiceOver; allow it, and turn on "Allow VoiceOver to be controlled with AppleScript" in
VoiceOver Utility, General. Your sessions and settings are in
`~/Library/Application Support/TheChatPlace`.

## Updates

The installed app checks for a new version a few seconds after it starts, and whenever you choose
Help, Check for Updates. At start the check only speaks up when there is a new version, and then
only says so: it never asks you anything you didn't ask for. From Help it always says what it found ("up to
date", "no release has been published yet", or an error), even with announcements set to silent.

The Help menu's update item always says which version you're running, as QuickMail's does:
**Check for Updates (running 0.1.4)...** (Alt+H, U). Once a check, at start or from Help, finds a
newer version, the item becomes **Update to 0.1.5 Available...** (still Alt+H, U), and choosing it
offers the update. If a later check finds nothing newer, it goes back to the running version; a
check that fails leaves it as it was.

**After an update.** The first time the updated app starts, a small dialog, **The Chat Place
Update Installed**, says "The Chat Place was updated to 0.1.5." Focus starts on **See what's new
in 0.1.5** (Alt+W), which opens that version's release notes on GitHub
(`https://github.com/kellylford/AIChat/releases/tag/v0.1.5`) and closes the dialog; **Close**
(Alt+C) or Escape just closes it. It waits until the main window is in front with no other dialog
open (a warning about a damaged file, say), so it never lands on top of another one; if that
doesn't happen within half an hour, the status bar says it instead. It's shown only by an
installed copy, only when the version is newer than the one that last started (recorded as
`last_run_version` in `speech.json` in the data folder), and never on a first run, after a
downgrade, from the portable zip or from source. Turn it off in Settings with "Tell me when an
update has been installed, with a link to what's new" (Alt+T).

From Help, a new version is offered in a Yes/No dialog where No is the default. If you choose Yes,
it downloads the update, closes, and starts the new version. It won't install while Claude is
working in one of its sessions, and it warns you if a reply box holds text you haven't sent. If a
turn starts, a dialog opens, or you type a reply while it downloads, it asks again or leaves the
update to be installed the next time The Chat Place starts.

The Mac app updates the same way. Velopack's updater is inside the app itself, so it works
wherever you keep it.

**Updating never touches your sessions or settings.** On Windows the app lives in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\TheChatPlace`, which Velopack replaces on update and removes on uninstall, and
your data is in `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace`. On a Mac, Velopack replaces the app itself, and your
data is in `~/Library/Application Support/TheChatPlace`. The updater refuses to run if the data
were ever inside what it replaces. What the updater did is logged in `update.log` in the data
folder.

The version is in Help, About. Releases come from tags named `v<version>`, and
each release carries two Velopack update feeds, `windows` (`releases.windows.json`) and `osx`
(`releases.osx.json`). The updater finds the newest `v*` release in this repository itself
and reads the feed from that release only (`REPO_URL`, `RELEASES_API`, `TAG_PREFIX` and `CHANNEL`
in `thechatplace/updater.py`).

## Run from source (development)

You need Python 3.11 to 3.13 (wxPython has wheels for those). The repo's virtual environment is
`.venv` (ignored by git). The setup scripts make it, install everything the app, the tests and
the build need (`requirements-build.txt`), and check it all imports, as Image Description
Toolkit's do. Each replaces an existing `.venv`.

| | Set up | Run | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | `winsetup.bat` | `.venv\Scripts\pythonw TheChatPlace.pyw` | `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests` |
| Mac | `./macsetup.sh`, or double-click `macsetup.command` | `.venv/bin/python -m thechatplace` | `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests` |

`python -m thechatplace` works on Windows too. A copy run from source doesn't update itself; Help, Check
for Updates says so, and names the newest release.

### Build it yourself

The build scripts are in `BuildAndRelease/`, laid out as in Image Description Toolkit:
`MacBuilds/` and `WinBuilds/`. Each does what the release workflow's job for that platform does:
makes `.venv` if it isn't there, runs the tests, builds the app with PyInstaller, smoke-tests it,
and packs it with Velopack, whose tool `vpk` needs the .NET SDK (the scripts install `vpk` at the
version the workflow uses). Results go in `releases\` and `dist\`; give a folder to copy the
installer or disk image there too, relative to where you ran the script.

**Windows.** `BuildAndRelease\WinBuilds\build_windows.cmd`, from a command prompt or by
double-clicking (the window then stays open to read the result). It makes the installer and
portable zip, **unsigned**: Windows signing is Azure Artifact Signing, which only the workflow
does, so SmartScreen may warn when you run Setup (More info, then Run anyway). Without the .NET SDK
it builds just the app, says why, and exits with an error.

```
BuildAndRelease\WinBuilds\build_windows.cmd
BuildAndRelease\WinBuilds\build_windows.cmd C:\Users\kelly\OneDrive\thehub
```

**Mac.** `BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh`, or double-click `build_macos.command`. It
makes `releases/TheChatPlace-macos-arm64.dmg` and the `osx` update feed, for Apple silicon. Like
IDT's, a local Mac build is **signed** with your Developer ID Application certificate when the
keychain has one; notarizing is up to you. The .NET SDK comes from `brew install dotnet`.

```
BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh                    signed if you have the certificate
BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh ~/Desktop/builds   and copy the .dmg there
TCP_SIGN_CODE=0 BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh    unsigned
TCP_NOTARIZE=1 BuildAndRelease/MacBuilds/build_macos.sh     signed and notarized (credentials: notarize.sh)
```

The Mac build follows GHManage's: the app is signed inside-out (`sign.sh`), `vpk pack` adds
Velopack's updater (`UpdateMac`) and signs that and the bundle, and the disk image is made from
the packed app, never from `dist/`. An app without `UpdateMac` runs perfectly and never updates
again, so the build checks that Velopack inside the packed app finds its updater. An unsigned
disk image's README.txt says how to open it (System Settings, Privacy & Security, Open Anyway).

### Releasing

The version lives in one place, `__version__` in `thechatplace/__init__.py`. To release:

1. Set `__version__`, and write `release-notes/v<version>.md` (what it is, what's new, downloads,
   requirements), in one commit on main.
2. Tag it `v<version>` and push the tag.

`.github/workflows/release-thechatplace.yml` then builds both platforms side by side, and
publishes one GitHub release (a pre-release before 1.0) only if both succeed:

- **Windows:** runs the tests, fails if the tag and `__version__` disagree, builds the app with
  PyInstaller, smoke-tests the built exe, signs it with Azure Artifact Signing, packs the Velopack
  installer, portable zip and update feed (signing Setup, the updater and the launcher too), and
  checks every signature.
- **Mac:** runs `build_macos.sh` with the Developer ID certificate in a throwaway keychain, so the
  app is signed, packed with its updater and notarized, the disk image notarized and stapled, and
  Gatekeeper's verdict checked. It needs the repository secrets `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12`,
  `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `NOTARY_KEY_P8`, `NOTARY_KEY_ID` and `NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`, which
  `The-Idea-Place-Projects/signing/sync-secrets.py` sets from the signing kit; a tag fails without
  them rather than publish an unsigned app.

Run by hand or for a pull request, it does everything but publish, and keeps the files as
workflow artifacts; tick "sign" on a hand run, or label a pull request `sign-build`, to sign (and
notarize) and check them too.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The same list is in the app under Help, Keyboard Shortcuts (F1), as a page with a heading and a
table for each group, so you can move by heading and read each key with what it does. Alt+P
shows it as plain text instead.

Menus are File (Alt+F), View (Alt+V) and Help (Alt+H). Controls have their own Alt letters
(Alt+L the session list, Alt+M the messages, Alt+Y the reply box, Alt+D Send), and none of them
takes a menu's letter.

On a Mac, Ctrl is the Command key, the menus are in the menu bar (VO+M) rather than on Alt, and
Settings is in the app menu.

## How it works

Everything it reads is on your own PC, so reading costs nothing.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| The desktop app's sessions | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code-sessions\<id>\<org>\local_<id>.json`: title, folder, last activity, archived, and sometimes a summary of the last turn that says whether it needs you. Archived sessions are left out. The Microsoft Store version of the desktop app keeps the same files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_<id>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude-code-sessions`; both places are read, and a session in both is read from the newer copy. |
| The desktop app's Cowork sessions | `%APPDATA%\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\<id>\<org>\local_<id>.json`, and the same under the Store version's package folder. The `local_<id>` folder beside each is that session's own Claude Code home: its conversation is in `.claude\projects\<folder>\<session>.jsonl` and its busy or idle file in `.claude\sessions`, not in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. Those paths are longer than Windows' usual 260-character limit, so they're read with the `\\?\` long-path form. |
| Terminal sessions | Every `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\<folder>\<session>.jsonl` that no desktop app or Chat Place session claims and whose records say Claude Code was started interactively (`"entrypoint": "cli"`, where `claude -p` writes `sdk-cli` and the desktop app `claude-desktop`). Its folder and title come from the transcript too. Each is read once, at its start and its last megabyte, and then only what's added to it. |
| Whether a session is working | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\sessions\<pid>.json`, which says busy or idle while Claude Code runs it. Files whose process has gone are ignored. |
| The conversation | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\<folder>\<session>.jsonl`, where `<folder>` is the session's folder with every character that isn't a letter or digit turned into `-`. This was checked against every transcript on Kelly's PC; if it ever misses, the app searches all the project folders for the session id instead. |
| The Chat Place's own sessions | `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\sessions.json` (and `speech.json` for settings). If `sessions.json` can't be read, it's renamed to `sessions.json.bad-<date>` rather than overwritten, and the app says so. |
| Your saved prompts | `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\prompts.json`. If it can't be understood, it's renamed to `prompts.json.bad-<date>` rather than overwritten, and the app says so. |
| Errors | `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace\error.log`: anything that went wrong unexpectedly, with its traceback |

None of these formats is documented, and Claude Code says the transcript format changes between
versions. So all the knowledge of it is in one small module (`thechatplace/transcript.py`) that
skips record types it doesn't know, never crashes on a line it can't read, and says "couldn't read
N lines" instead. A long transcript is read once, then only its new lines as it grows.

**The Chat Place never writes to the desktop app's files or to any transcript.** The only files it
writes are its own, in `%APPDATA%\TheChatPlace`. Only one copy runs at a time; starting a second
brings the first to the front.

### Its own sessions, and why desktop sessions are read-only

The Chat Place drives its own sessions with the `claude` command in print (headless) mode:
`claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode <mode>
--permission-prompts host --permission-prompt-tool stdio`, with `--session-id` and `--name` for the
first message and `--resume <id>` for each reply, plus `--allowedTools` with any rules you chose
"for this session". The message goes in on standard input as a stream-json message, and standard
input stays open for the turn so The Chat Place can answer what Claude asks; it's closed when the
turn's result arrives. That runs under the same login as the desktop app, never an API key; it
uses the plan's Agent SDK credit, as any `claude -p` does.

- It never uses `--bare`, which needs an API key.
- It needs the native `claude.exe`. The npm install's `claude.cmd` is never run, because Windows
  runs a `.cmd` through `cmd.exe`, which would let characters in a session title run a command.
  A newer npm install's `claude.cmd` only starts the same native `claude.exe` from
  `node_modules`, so that program is run directly instead; an old one that runs `cli.js` through
  Node is refused. Off the PATH, it looks in `~/.local/bin` (the native installer) and WinGet's
  `Links` folder on Windows, and in `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin` and
  `~/.npm-global/bin` on a Mac, where an app started from the Finder doesn't get your shell's
  PATH.
- Before starting `claude` it removes two named sets of environment variables, and keeps the rest
  (your `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, proxy and timeout settings). The first set
  is what a Claude session puts in the environment of anything started inside it: started from
  there, the app would otherwise pass on variables that point `claude` at the desktop app's local
  proxy and tell it someone else will refresh its sign-in, and the run then waits for a refresh
  that never comes. The second is anything that would move billing off the subscription:
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and the Bedrock, Vertex and
  Foundry switches. Both lists are in `claude_cli.py`.
- As a second check, `claude` reports where its credentials came from before it sends anything.
  If that's an API key rather than the subscription login, The Chat Place stops the run and says so.

Desktop app sessions are read-only because two programs resuming one session run their turns into
the same transcript at once and tangle it. Only the desktop app writes to its sessions, and only
The Chat Place writes to its own. The rule is enforced in code: The Chat Place refuses to build a
`--resume` command for any session it didn't start, any session the desktop app knows about
(archived ones included), or any `local_` id, and there are tests for each. It also won't send
into one of its own sessions while that session is running somewhere else. Continue Here is the
one exception that reads a desktop session through `claude`, and it doesn't write to it:
`--resume <desktop id> --fork-session --session-id <new id>` copies the history into a new
session. Checked with Claude Code 2.1.286: the desktop session's transcript was byte for byte the
same afterwards, and Claude knew the earlier conversation. One turn runs at a time
per session. Send during a turn queues the message: The Chat Place says "Queued", and once the
turn's reply has been announced, it sends the message. More messages sent while one is waiting
join it, and they go together as one message. Each queued message is at the end of the
messages list as "Queued: …": Delete removes it, and its context menu has Send Now (Ctrl+Enter:
Claude stops what it's doing and answers it straight away, in the same turn), Edit Queued Message
(back into the message box, to change and send again) and Remove Queued Message. Turn status
(Ctrl+Shift+T) says when a message is queued. If the turn fails, or you press Stop, the queued text goes back in the message box
instead, ahead of anything typed since, with the cursor left at the end. While one of
The Chat Place's sessions is loaded, Send and Stop are never disabled, so from the message box, Tab
is always Send and the next Tab is always Stop. When a turn is running, Tab doesn't jump past
Send to Stop.

Every announcement is also written to `speech.log` in `%TEMP%\thechatplace-speak` (on a Mac,
`$TMPDIR/thechatplace-speak`), one line each: the time, whether it interrupts or waits its turn,
the speech engine, and its opening words. On Windows, with a screen reader setting, a `route:` line
usually follows it: "spoke through NVDA", "no screen reader running, so a Windows voice", or why a running
screen reader didn't speak. A line means the text was handed to the speech engine,
not that it was heard: a later announcement that interrupts can cut it off. The log shows
whether a reply went to the screen reader at all when you didn't hear it.

A turn runs `claude` in a Windows job object, so Stop, or quitting the app, ends `claude` and every
program it started (a build or test run, say), not just `claude` itself. The same happens when a
turn finishes. Background commands are the exception: while Claude Code reports a command it ran
in the background still running (a build, or `gh pr checks --watch`, say), the turn stays open
even after Claude answers, because Claude Code starts a turn of its own when the command finishes,
and ending the turn would kill it and leave nothing to pick it up (#161). The answer is announced
at once with what is still running ("Still running in the background: Windows build"), the
session's row says "answered, background work running", and the turn ends when Claude goes idle
with nothing left running. While it waits, Send goes straight to Claude as the next message rather
than queuing, and anything already queued goes in then; Turn Status (Ctrl+Shift+T) names the work
still running. (A background agent is different: Claude Code keeps working until the agent is done,
so the turn simply runs until then and its answer is said at the end, as with any turn.)
Something meant to run indefinitely, such as a development server, would keep the turn open until
you press Stop, so ask Claude to start long-running servers in a terminal of your own.
`claude` is started suspended and only let run once it's in the job, so nothing it starts can
slip out first.

### What headless sessions do with questions and permissions

Checked with Claude Code 2.1.286 (issues #187 and #188):

- **Permission prompts, questions and plans come to The Chat Place.** With
  `--permission-prompts host --permission-prompt-tool stdio`, anything that would ask arrives on
  the turn's output as a `can_use_tool` request, the same control protocol the Agent SDK uses,
  and the turn waits for the answer on its input. AskUserQuestion and ExitPlanMode come the same
  way: a question is answered by allowing the tool with the answers added to its input, a plan
  is approved by allowing it with a switch of permission mode, and Keep Planning denies it with
  your note. Each was checked against the real CLI: an allowed Write wrote its file; a denied
  one didn't, and Claude quoted the reason it was given; an approved plan carried on in accept
  edits without asking again.
- **Refusals still happen without asking** where Claude Code's own rules say so (a write outside
  the session's folder, say, or auto mode's safety check). The Chat Place adds those to the
  announcement ("1 tool was refused: ..."), marks the session "needs you", and the chat shows a
  "Permission denied" line.
- Question cards in desktop app sessions are shown as text in the chat ("Claude asked: ...,
  Options: ...", then "You answered: ...") and answered in Claude.

## Limitations

- On a Mac, edit boxes, lists and
  choices have their names under VoiceOver, as under JAWS and NVDA. But the text a screen reader
  reads for each row of the messages list (the whole message) uses MSAA, which wxPython has only
  on Windows, so VoiceOver reads the row's own text instead. The OS-specific parts are in
  `thechatplace/platform_paths.py`, `thechatplace/ui/a11y.py`, `thechatplace/ui/mac_a11y.py` and
  the speech scripts.
- "Needs you" for desktop sessions depends on the desktop app's turn summary, which it doesn't
  always write. A session without one shows as idle once it stops working.
- A desktop session's transcript can be gone if it's older than Claude Code's retention period
  (`cleanupPeriodDays`, 90 days on Kelly's PC). The chat says so.
- The Chat Place's own sessions, and terminal sessions, don't appear in the desktop app, so Open in
  Claude doesn't work for them; the app says so.
- Cowork sessions can't be continued here. Their conversation is in the session's own Claude Code
  folder inside the desktop app's files, where `claude -p` on your PC can't resume it, and its
  tools were run by the desktop app. Open in Claude carries on there.
- Subagent conversations are left out of the chat.
- Turns of The Chat Place's own sessions are also spoken by ClaudeSpeak's Stop hook, if that's
  installed, since `claude -p` runs hooks; so a reply can be heard twice.
- The desktop app's file formats are undocumented and could change with any update.
